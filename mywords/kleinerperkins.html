      <p> 9 inches. The size of my footstep. How could I ever make an impact on
         a world with a surface area of approximately 510 million km&sup2;? </p>

      <p> I always asked my parents growing up what kept them going through the
        unspeakable hardships they endured to immigrate from Vietnam to the United States.
        From being stranded on an island for many years, having no food or water
        for days, to being robbed by Thai pirates, I admired their commitment to
        escape the communism in Vietnam in order to have freedom.  </p>
        <p>So, you might be wondering… what kept them going? This was their
          response— “what kept us going was the future. Future job. Future family.
           Future neighbors. Future grandkids. That is our why.” </p>
           <p><em> Wow... how humbling is that? </em></p>
           <p>Inspired by my parents, I want to make an impact on the world through
              my mission to address disparities in access to technology in underserved
              communities. With my passion for technology and education, I hope to make
               a direct impact on the e-learning experience and leverage technology
               to make education accessible to all. Our education is the best
               investment that we can make. Education creates our future. It
               enables the next generation to be better equipped for the impact
               they wish to make on the world.</p>
               <p>So, thanks to the impact my parents have made on me, I am
                 passionate about making an impact to better our future.</p>

     <h6> Describe your most meaningful experience(s) and why they matter to you. </h6>
     <p><strong>Creating my first horribly designed mobile application:</strong>
       During high school, I developed a <a target="_blank" href="../pages/xtable.html">mobile application</a> allowing children to
        practice multiplication. Despite my lack of coding experience, this project
         meant a lot to me because this was my first introduction to the potential
         of programming. Since then, I have learned the importance of creating
          user-friendly layouts, making navigation intuitive, and many other
          skills beyond mobile development.</p>
      <p><strong>Leading a classroom of refugee children virtually:</strong>
      After mentoring a 4th grader from Vietnam and developing a close relationship
       with his family, I realized my love for cultivating relationships with
       children and families. This led me to become a classroom coordinator for
        <a target="_blank" href="https://kenan.ethics.duke.edu/refugee-project/">
          Launch Lab</a>, a weekly mentoring program for refugee youth ages 4th to 8th
        grade in the Durham area. This year has been especially difficult
        transitioning to online, but we have continued to build community, help
         mentees become confident in learning, and develop their communication skills.</p>
      <p><strong>My first hackathon:</strong> With 24 hours, a teammate and I
        created <a target="_blank" href="https://devpost.com/software/dishin">
          Dishin</a>, a mobile application that connects home cooks with the
        local community, looking for authentic, homemade meals. With no sleep,
        spending 4+ hours fixing laptop issues, I was able to complete the
        front-end and part of the backend using Flutter, while implementing
        Firebase. When it was over, I was sleep-deprived, but it paid off because
        we won first in our track, best hack for eCommerce, and 3rd overall out
         of 300+ participants. For my first hackathon, it taught me how to work
         efficiently and collaborate under pressure.</p>
