      <h2>Overview </h2>
      <h6>Objective</h6>
      <p> Redesigning the Duke University Computer Science Department's website
        by creating prototypes of the main landing pages with a focus on user
        experience that is being implemented to their website.</p>
      <h6> My Role </h6>
      <p> Working on a team of 2 interns, 1 faculty project lead, and 2 computer
        science IT staff, I was responsible for the design and research aspect
        of our project. Throughout this internship, I...
        <ul>
          <li> Met with the team weekly to discuss the designs and the
            <strong>user experience</strong></li>
          <li> Engaged with the other intern in the <strong>human-centered design</strong>
            process by leading meetings</li>
          <li> Created <strong>prototypes</strong> for all main landing pages in Adobe XD</li>
          <li> Recieved <strong>feedback</strong> on the designs from Prof. Jun Yung,
            the CS Department Chair</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

        <h2> Research</h2>
        <h6> Explore CS Websites </h6>
        <p>To begin, my team reviewed Duke's current website at the time. We also
          looked at multiple CS Department's website from other universities to
          brainstorm design ideas. </p>
        <p>We though about the <strong>most common information people view the CS
            department's website:</strong></p>
        <div id="reasons">
          <p>Undergraduate information</p>
          <p>Graduate Program information</p>
          <p>Research opportunities and information</p>
          <p>Major or Minor requirements</p>
          <p>Latest News and Upcoming Events</p>
          <p>Contact information <br> for people</p>
          <p>Prospective Student information</p>
          <p>Industry Partners information</p>
        </div>
        <h6> The current website experience</h6><br>
        <p> Here's the initial Duke CS Department's website. It gets the job done,
          but it can be tricky to find information and isn't very visually appealing.</p>
        <img width="100%" src="../img/pages/csdeptoriginalpage.png"><br><br>
        <br>
        <p> Unsurprisingly, we found that <strong>visitors often struggle navigating
            through the website</strong>. The lack of engaging content created difficulties
          when finding the links for the most important information.</p>

      <h2> Ideation</h2>
      <h6>How might we create a visually appealing website that enables visitors
        to easily navigate to what they need? </h6>
      <br>
      <h6>Task analysis</h6>
      <p>When my team began thinking about what pages had the most traffic on, we
        decided the <strong>homepage and the undergraduate, graduate, and research
          landing page</strong> were the ones we would focus on.</p>
      <h6>Website Restrictions</h6>
      <ul>
        <li>Adhere to the <a href="https://brand.duke.edu/" target="_blank">Duke Brand Guide</a></li>
        <li>Needs to be compatible with the current Drupal framework being used
          to develop the website</li>
        <li>The header and footer sections in Duke blue and the arrangement
          of the navigation in black </li>
        <li> All colors and logo fonts come from the
          <a href="https://brand.duke.edu/colors/" target="_blank">Duke palette</a>,
          but the blues and green are most essential based on how we're identifying
          CS as part of the university and as a part of the Natural Sciences</li>
        <li>The large featured photo is a common theme being used on Trinity websites.
          However, it would be useful to have more information conveyed, possibly by
          the use of other design elements</li>
        <li>Keep the infographics that demonstrate "points of pride", although
          how this is displayed can be altered</li>
      </ul>
      <h6>Brainstorming pages</h6>
      <p><strong>Homepage:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Convey more information than just a large picture </li>
        <li>Utilize the empty space in the wide side gutters, or at least reduce their width</li>
        <li> Improve the aesthetic appeal of the homepage by the use of
          a larger variety of colors in the Duke palette, tighter fonts, and more
          innovative design elements (unevenness, tiles, overlays, etc.) </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Landing Pages:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Design principle of these pages should be aligned with that of the homepage</li>
        <li>Less text and more graphics</li>
        <li>Clear summary of how the section is organized and easy navigation</li>
        <li>A richer palette and innovative design elements</li>
        <li>Highlight the main messages instead of giving detailed information</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <h6> Main Design Goals </h6>
      <ul>
        <li> An easy-to-navigate website experience</li>
        <li> Aesthetically appealing designs</li>
        <li> More information to be accessible with less scrolling</li>
        <li> Provide concise information for readers to understand </li>

        <h2> Designing</h2>
        <h6>Stepping into Design</h6>
        <p>With all the restrictions we already had before starting the designs,
          I began creating an idea of the color pallete, the website aesthetic,
          and what the homepage would look like.</p>
        <h6>Homepage</h6>
        <p>By using a grid-based layout, we started off with a simple design
          including all required sections: Events, Latest News, Research, and Contact.
          <br><br>
          From the first design to the second, we rearranged the pride points at
          the top of the page, changed the background colors of the sections,
          expanded the latest news section to be a gallery. The most difficult
          section was the Contact because I had a hard time figuring out how to
          organize the different social platforms.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="wrapper">
        <img width="100%" src="../img/pages/dukewebhome.png">
      </div>
      <div class="project-wrapper">
        <p>Continuing the changes in design, we had incorporated more colors to
          create an inviting aesthetic. We also got rid of the Featured Video section
          and replaced it with an Our People because the Contact section would display
          the youtube videos.
          <br><br>
          In addition, I edited the footer section by adding the social media icons
          to the footer so all pages of the website would allow you to reach the
          different social media platforms and also simplified the quick links
          under each section of the footer.
          <br><br>
          We finally were finished with our homepage and ready to tackle
          the three main landing pages!</p>
        </p>

        <img width="100%" src="../img/pages/dukewebhome2.png">
      </div>
      <div class="project-wrapper">
        <h6>Landing Pages</h6>
        <p>We created a consistent aesthetic that we made sure to incorporate in
          the other landing pages. By using the same fonts, color pallete, and
          grid-based layout, we designed the Undergraduate, Graduate, and
          Research landing pages.</p>
        <br>
      </div>
      <div class="wrapper">
        <img width="100%" src="../img/pages/dukeweblanding.png">

        <div style="border: solid 1px #efefef; width: 100%;"></div>
      </div>
      <br><br>
      <div class="project-wrapper">
        <h6>Feedback</h6>
        <p> Once we finished our designs, we were able to reach out to Professor
          Jun Yang, the CS Department Chair, to recieve feedback with our designs
          for the department's website. He suggested we include pride points on
          the landing pages for Undergraduate, Graduate and the Research section as well.</p>
        <h6> Improvements and Changes</h6>
        <p> Based on Professor Yang's Feedback, I made these changes to the website
          design using a similar design on the homepage of overlaying the pictures
          with text and badges.

        We also decided as a team to make one final change on the Our people section
        from the homepage to reflect the Research section's design.</p>

  <section id="takeaways">
    <div class="project-wrapper">
      <h2> Takeaways </h2>
      <h6>Knowing the audience</h6>
      <p>Think about our audience! When developing our designs we continuously asked ourselves
        <i>How will the typical audience interact with our design?</i>. With this
        in mind, I was able to focus on the user experience while incorporating
        the information needed.</p>
      <h6> Empathy for teammates </h6>
      <p> Teamwork makes the [UX] dream work! Because the internship was remote,
        we as a team understood the challenges that come with working from home.
        We scheduled meetings according to everyone's availability first and foremost.</p>
      <h6> Adhering to Restrictions </h6>
      <p>One of the difficulties when developing an academic institution's
        website is the requirement to adhere to specific guidelines. The team
        had to actively think about the image of Duke Trinity College of Arts
        & Science and make sure we do not design a website that would not be
        representative of the typical Trinity website.</p>
      <h6> Improved Design Skills </h6>
      <p>After completing this internship, I believe I have gained a valuable
        understanding of important design principles. The importance of simplicity,
        easy navigation, grid-based layouts, and consistency are some of the things
        I kept in mind when trying to create an aesthetic, user-friendly website design.</p>
