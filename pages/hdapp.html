      <h2> Overview </h2>
      <h6>Objective</h6>
      <p> The Code For Good mobile application serves to aid attendees of <strong>HackDuke's
          premiere hackathon</strong> by providing users with interactive schedules,
        check-in capabilities, directional maps, and a list of frequently asked questions.</p>
      <h6> My Role </h6>
      <p> Working with one other member of HackDuke Tech Team, we were responsible
        for creating the android version of the Code for Good application for HackDuke.</p>

        <h2> Development </h2>
        <h6>A 3-week time crunch</h6>
        <p> Given less than <strong>3 weeks</strong> to complete the app before the day of the hackathon,
          I began building our app's visual components in Android Studio's storyboard
          and writing code for the pages.</p>
        <h6> Staying flexible</h6>
        <p> With a short amount of time we had to <strong>prioritize features that
            would contribute the most to a minimum viable product</strong> over those
          that would complicate and lengthen development. We only included what was
          most essential to our attendees's user experience.</p>

          <h6> Check-in Page </h6>
          <p> We initially allowed attendees to check-in within the app, but it was
            difficult to have two places for check-in: <strong>the app and a google form</strong>. Therefore,
            after some last minute decisions, we decided to change our check-in page to
            become a button shown below that directs the attendee to fill out the google form.</p>

        <h2> Takeaways</h2>
        <h6>Timely Manner</h6>
        <p>This was my first coding task coming to college and was taken aback
          by how short of a time span we had. However, I was more productive when working
          on the project knowing we had such a short time to complete it. I believe the app was done
          to the best of my abilities considering the timespan. If I were to do it again,
          I would have liked to include a live chat for attendees to ask questions
          they may have during the hackathon.</p>
        <h6> User-friendly </h6>
        <p>The simple design of the app was something I considered when developing
          the app. The app allows for easy navigation and understanding of the use.
          By only having one main page with a navigation bar directing to three
          other pages, it prevented any user from being confused where things were.</p>
        <h6> Git Version Control </h6>
        <p>Once again, this was my first coding project where I worked with more than
          just myself. This was a great introduction to using Git version control.
          I now know the essential git commands to do certain tasks such as checking
          out a repository, adding files, pushing to master, etc. Git allowed for
          me to keep track of all the changes in source code during the development.</p>
