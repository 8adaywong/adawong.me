          color schemes were </i> </p>
      <h6> My first real intro to app development </h6>
      <p> I took <strong> AP Computer Science </strong> my senior year of high
        school and created this for my final project. I used Java and the IDE Android Studios.</p>
      <img width=100% src="../img/pages/xtablemanual.png">
      <h6> But why build this? </h6>
      <p>Our final project was extremely open-ended. The only requirements were
        to demonstrate our understanding of the programming language Java and apply
        it to the real world.</p>
      <p>As I was exploring ideas, I tried to think of problems around me that I
        could solve. I remembered my mother mentioning she was teaching multiplication
        problems to some of her more advanced students and decided I could help.</p>
      <h6> Technical challenges </h6>
      <p>I had no prior experience with android app development besides a course
        on Swift. Therefore, I initially had to get over a small learning curve for
        Android Studios.</p>
      <p>Customization! Figuring out how to set the number of questions depending
        on the user input and then updating it all live in my app was something I
        had trouble with because it was something I had never really learned in class. </p>
      <p>Retrieving the correct answer to display. If the user submitted an incorrect
        answer, I had to pull the correct answer from an array and display it.</p>
      <p>Final Score! Redirecting the buttons! I had to keep track of the number
        of correct answers to display a final score. I then had an end screen that
        allowed them to play again or redirect them back to the home page. I
        needed to process the connections between each of my pages.</p>

      <h6> What I would do differently </h6>
      <ul>
        <li>Create a landing page before presenting the main page to welcome users</li>
        <li>Implement constraints depending on the user's screen size</li>
        <li> Display the correct answer regardless of the user gets the question correct or not</li>
        <li>Create a scoreboard similar to Quizlet to compare with other students in the class</li>
      </ul>
      <h6>This kick-started my journey to learning how to <i> build </i> things </h6>
      <p> It's an exciting world out there when you know how to code! I want to keep
        playing around with app development to see what's possible â€“ I want to learn how to create
        fun and useful things. Knowing full-stack development is so powerful. My next
        steps are to learn more about the back-end and front-end and frameworks like React or Flutter.</p>
